# Package Managers

#packaging

A **package manager** or **package management system** is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner.

Package managers are designed to eliminate the need for manual installs and updates.

Packages contain metadata
	e.g.- name, description, version number, and a list of dependencies
	
Upon installation the package manager will install the dependencies locally. 

Examples of package managers:
- Yarn (ts, js)
- [[Poetry]] (python)
